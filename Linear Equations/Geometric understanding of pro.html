     <h1>Geometric understanding of properties of proportions</h1>


    <p>Consider two lines CA and CB. Let CA be divided into equal number of parts&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(ce = er = rs = ...\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;and let&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(eh , rm , sp\)</span>&nbsp;…
        be drawn parallel to AB, then CB will be divided into same number of equal
        parts&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(ch = hm = mp = ...\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <img class="image_resized" style="width:31.31%;" src="Ratio%20and%20Proportions/Properties%20of%20Ratio%20and%20Proportions/Geometric%20understanding%20of%20properties%20of%20proportions/image.png">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Draw hn, mo, ... parallel to CA ; then the triangles ceh and hnm will
      be similar ; because of the parallel lines, ehnr will be a parallelogram
      , and therefore nh = re = ec, Lmhnhce, and hnm = ceh ; &nbsp;, hm = ch.
      In precisely the same way it may be shown that mp = ch, and so on.</p>
    <p>Taking any of the points r in CA, it follows that cr will be contained
      in CA as many times as cm is contained in CB, that is</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\frac {CA}{Cr} = \frac {CB}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;
      or&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(CA:Cr :: CB:Cm\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>This derivation is known as Basic Proportionality theorem, derived in
      NCERT Class X, Theorem 6.1, using a different geometric principle. &nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Derivation of other properties</h2>
    <p>Using the same above approach, we will notice that&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\frac{Cr}{Ce} = \frac{Cm}{Ch}\)</span>&nbsp;
      &nbsp;which is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {Ce+er}{Ce} = \frac{Cm+hm}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;
      on simplification gives&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1+\frac{er}{Ce} = 1 + \frac{hm}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;
      which gives the relation&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{er}{Ce} = \frac{hm}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;(
      Which is true by the geometric reasoning above).</p>
    <p>All other properties can be derived similarly.</p>
    <h2>Observations from the construction :</h2>
    <p>When two lines intersect, a similar triangle and a parallelogram are form.</p>
    <p>If the two lines were not intersecting, say represent the same line (overlapping),
      neither the triangle nor the parallelogram will be formed.</p>
    <p>If the two lines were parallel, only the parallelograms would have formed,
      the similar triangles will not be formed.</p>
    <p>These observations will be later used in solutions of linear equations.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>What if the line CA cannot be equally divided using Cr as a measure ?</h2>
    <p>This is a typical challenge that the student will face doing this construction
      activity. &nbsp;This is an opportunity to learn about Limits, without actually
      needing to know the term “limits”.</p>
    <p>Let cr be divided into any number of equal parts, and measure off one
      of them from r towards A ; let an be the portion in excess, then draw nv
      parallel to AB. Because cn and cr are commensurable, we have, by the above
      theorem, &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {cm}{cr} = \frac {cv}{cn}\)</span>&nbsp;;</p>
    <p>but&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(Cn= CA + An\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(CV = CB + Bv\)</span>, by substitution</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\frac {CA+An}{Cr} = \frac {CB+Bv}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;
      or&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {CA}{Cr} + \frac{An}{Cr} = \frac{Cb}{Cm} + \frac{Bv}{Cm}\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>By increasing the number of divisions in cr, the excess An and вv may
      BU be made as small as we please; therefore&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{An}{Cr}\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(\frac{Bv}{Cm}\)</span>&nbsp;may be indefinitely decreased ( to the extent
        we want) and will ultimately have&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {CA}{Cr} = \frac {CB}{Cm}\)</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Latent connections to other concepts ( will be referred to in other articles)</h2>
    <p>This geometric construction is used in the following concepts</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
      <li>Geometric construction of “Divide a line in any number of equal parts”.
        This &nbsp;in turn is used in Coordinate Geometry - Section formula.</li>
      <li>In &nbsp;heights and distances</li>
    </ol>
