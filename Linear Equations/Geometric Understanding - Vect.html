     <h1>Geometric Understanding - Vectors</h1>


    <p>This section continues with the same numerical example, to understand
      the solution geometrically.</p>
    <p>It has been observed from the solution the following</p>
    <p>To buy 1 kg of rice means to return 1 packets of N ( or -1 of N) &nbsp;and
      3 packets of S. Similarly,</p>
    <p>To Buy 1 Kg of wheat would mean to buy 2 &nbsp;packets of N and return
      5 packets of S ( or -5 of S).</p>
    <h4>Geometric Construction.</h4>
    <p>Take two orthogonal axes representing N ( number of packets of N) and
      S ( Number of packets of S).</p>
    <p>On this plot, 1 kg of rice is represented by the line segment OA, with
      point A being (-1,3).</p>
    <p>Similarly 1kg of wheat will be represented by segment OB, with point B
      being (2,-5).</p>
    <p>To mark 26 kg of rice in this picture would mean to scale line segment
      OA, 26 times, which will land at the pint OC, where C being (-26,78).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Similarly, 15 kg of rice would mean extending the line segmenting OB to
      OD, such that OD is 15 times OB, leading D to be the point (30,-75).</p>
    <p>These two lines OA and OB provided us the direction to add for additional
      kg of Rice and Wheat respectively.</p>
    <p>But the problem asks for 26 kg of rice and 15 kg of wheat,</p>
    <p>So from OC, we move in the direction of OB, adding 1kg of wheat at a time
      ( Draw a line parallel to OB from C, with a length equal to OB). We could
      also start at D (the point representing required kg of wheat) and go in
      a parallel direction &nbsp;for every kg of rice until 26 kg is met. These
      two lines intersect at point P, which is the required number of N and S,
      and in this case is (4,3).</p>

    <h4>Another way to interpret</h4>
    <p>The x-coordinate of C represents the number of N required, and x-coordinate
      of D represents number of N required for (26,15). Adding these x-ccordinates
      gives&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(-26+30=4\)</span>&nbsp; of N. Similarly,
      &nbsp;adding y-ccordinates of points C and D gives number of packets of
      S required&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(78-75=3\)</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Latent Concepts</h4>
    <p>This approach has intrinsically captured the essence of Vectors addition
      and dot products.&nbsp;</p>
