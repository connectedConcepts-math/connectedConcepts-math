     <h1>Activities in detail</h1>

    <h4>GA.1 : Scaling of line segments using parallelograms</h4>
    <p>Take a line segment AB. Construct using parallelograms lengths 2AB, 3AB
      etc. Also construct&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac {!}{2} AB\)</span>,&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(\frac {1}{3} AB\)</span>&nbsp;etc.</p>
    <p>This exercise is typically done in school text book using compass and
      a scale. Using this approach would mean that the student already has a
      graduated scale.</p>
    <p>This activity allows the students to create a graduated scale of their
      own kind, and they can check if their graduations are accurate using the
      scale from their geometry box.</p>
    <h5>Procedure</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Draw Line segment AB</li>
      <li>Draw any line AC ( at any angle)</li>
      <li>Complete the parallelogram ACDB</li>
      <li>Join the diagonal BC</li>
      <li>From D, draw line parallel to BC to meet AB extended at F.</li>
      <li>AF will be 2 AB</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Learning outcomes&nbsp;</h5>
    <p>This exercise will allow students to&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create their own scale</li>
      <li>Understand properties of parallelogram</li>
      <li>Ability to measure using oblique axes ( textbooks promote measurement
        only with orthogonal axes).</li>
      <li>Taking the line AB at various inclinations, will give a view on vector
        addition</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>GA 2 : Construct different parallelograms with the same diagonal</h4>
    <p>Consider a line segment AB ( in any orientation) as a diagonal of a parallelogram.
      Construct different parallelograms with AB as diagonal. You will be able
      to draw quite a number of them.</p>
    <p>Verify the coordinates of point R as shown in first diagram, with others
      that you draw.</p>

    <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
    <p>This exercise will&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide an opportunity to understand orientation of lines with respect
        to different coordinate systems.</li>
      <li>Provide an understanding of relationships amongst the lengths and coordinates
        of the enclosing parallelogram</li>
      <li>Will become basis for Vectors, specially resolution of vectors.</li>

    </ul>
    <h4>RA 1: Find the distance of point of intersection&nbsp;</h4>
    <p>Take any two line segments AB and CD that are inclined. From two fixed
      points &nbsp;A and P on AB, find the perpendicular distance to line CD,
      i.e., PC and AQ.. Measure AP.</p>
    <p>Using these measurements, find</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Determine the direction of intersection of AB and CD when extended - will
        it be direction of AB or BA ? Give reasons.</li>
      <li>Determine the distance from A where the lines AB and CD will meet when
        extended.</li>
      <li>Determine the angle between the lines AB and CD when extended.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Use lines with different inclinations and repeat the exercise. Estimate
      the point of intersection, when the lines intersect out of range of paper
      that you are working on.</p>
    <p>Which of these statements is True</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\angle APC+ \angle PCQ &gt;180\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\angle APC + \angle PCQ &lt;180\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\angle CQA + \angle QAP &lt;180\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(\angle CQA + \angle QAP &gt; 180\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>Reason why the sum of the above angles will each be 180 if AB and CD were
      parallel.</p>

    <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
    <p>Students will&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li>appreciate importance of direction</li>

    <h4>PA -1</h4>
    <p>Create two packets M and N, with M containing 5 Biscuits and 3 Chocolates,
      and N containing 3 Biscuits and 1 Chocolate. If the packets can be re-arranged
      like in the numerical problem, what would you to get exactly 1 Chocolate,
      exactly 1 Biscuit. To get 15 Chocolates and 25 Biscuits?</p>
    <p>Change the number of chocolates and Biscuits to repeat this activity.</p>
