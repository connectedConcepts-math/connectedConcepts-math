     <h1>Solution of Linear Equations - Various Connections covered</h1>


    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This section will contain examples of solving Linear equations. The methods
      demonstrated in these examples will cover&nbsp;</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
      <li>Using Equivalent fractions : Linear equations that are formed as ratios
        will be converted to equivalent fractions and solved using “ Visual Fractions”
        ( Like the whole-part diagrams that are introduced in <strong>Class 4/5</strong>. &nbsp;The
        same problem is solved without the need for visuals.)</li>
      <li>A visual approach to using Similar triangles will be demonstrated. This
        example is to emphasize that ratio-proportion problems can be represented
        as similar triangles <Strong> Class X </Strong> (for two-variables).</li>
      <li>A method to convert Linear equations to be expressed as ratios is described.
        Post conversion of Linear equations to Ratios, the first method is used
        to solve them.<strong> Connect Class X to Class 7 </strong>/li>
      <li>Using the Geometric defintion of a point -a point in two dimensions can be described as
        one that has fixed ratio of its distance from three lines, a method is
        for solving pair of linear equations is evolved. This method will find
        applications in Computer Vision, though not restricted to it.<strong>Connecting Geometry </strong></li>
      <li>A brief understanding of the properties of linear functions, that is “Principle
        of Superposition” is introduced and the same will be applied to solving
        a pair of linear equations. This method will give a Segway to Vectors.<Strong> Connecting Linear Equations (Class X) to Vectors (Class XII)</Strong>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>An ensemble of the above methods is used to extend the concept to Solution
        of equations in three dimensions.<strong> Connecting Ratio and Proportion (Class 7) to Linear Equations in 3 Variables (Class 11)</strong></li>
      <li>Some of the above methods will be used to demonstrate the representation
        of Linear equations as a matrix, and the solution based on elimination
        method ( Reduced Row Echelon) is explored. <strong> Connections to Matrix (Class XI) </strong></li>
