     <h1>solving Linear equations in 2 variables using Similar Triangles</h1>

    <p>We have seen that Linear equations expressed as proportions have ratios
      within them. We have also seen that the properties of proportions use Similar
      triangles * Derivation of Basic Proportionality theorem). We take the same
      age problem and solve using similar triangles here.</p>
    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <p>Ratio of John's age to his Father 10 years ago is 1:5. Six years later,
      the ratio of their ages becomes 3:7. &nbsp;Find their current ages.</p>
    <h4>Some Preliminaries</h4>
    
    <p>In the context of the problem, we know the following facts</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Age increases by 1 year, every year.</li>
      <li>Age difference between Father and Son, remains the same the end of every
        year.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using these facts, we can plot a graph of ages of Father and John, with
      Y-axis as Age, and X-axis as Year. Since we do not know, when exactly Father
      and John were born, we can mark any two points on X- axis ( the year they
      were born) - from these two points, we can draw a 45 degree line (Age increases
      by 1 year , every year ; meaning slope of the line will be 1).</p>

      <p>From the picture above, we can see</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Following triangles are similar</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >SBP and RBJ, MAP and NAJ, XTP and YTJ</span>

      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Considering Triangles, SBP and RBJ</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span class="math-tex">\(\frac{(d+x)}{x} = \frac{5}{1}\)</span>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;which gives &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(d=4x\)</span>&nbsp;( applying
        dividendo property of ratios)</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">Considering Triangles <span>MAP and NAP</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span class="math-tex">\(\frac{(d+16)}{(x+6)} = \frac{7}{3}\)</span>&nbsp;
        &nbsp;, Substituting&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(d=4x\)</span>&nbsp;(from
        above) , gives&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(d= 32 \space x=8\)</span>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">Which tells us that the difference in the age of Father and age of John
        is 32.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">From Triangles XTP and YTP,</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span class="math-tex">\(\frac{(d+x+10)}{(x+10)} = \frac{XT}{YT}\)</span>,
        &nbsp;Also&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(JT = YT\)</span>&nbsp; and&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(PT=XT\)</span>&nbsp;( 45 degree )</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">Solving gives&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(XT = 50 \space and &nbsp;YT =18\)</span>

      <h3 style="margin-left:0in;">Intriguing Questions based on the approach</h3>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">Why does this graphical approach work ?</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0in;">It works because ratios are preserved when projected onto diagnol&nbsp;</p>
      <p
      style="margin-left:0in;">The general problem to solving simultaneous equations appear as equations
        and not as ratios. Can Simultaneous equations be converted to ratios?&nbsp;</p>
        <p
        style="margin-left:0in;">Can this approach be solved to use any pair of Linear equations ?</p>
          <p
          style="margin-left:0in;">Does this approach extend to simultaneous equations in 3 variables ?&nbsp;</p>
