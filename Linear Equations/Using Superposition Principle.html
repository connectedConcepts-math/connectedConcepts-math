     <h1>Using Superposition Principle</h1>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>The word “Superposition” principle is not explicitly stated in the text
      book. However the properties of this principle are used at various places.
      In view of avoiding using any terminology outside of the the text book,
      &nbsp;the properties will be used.</p>
    <p>The fundamental method used in this method is “Unitary Method”, as described
      in the Chapter on Ratio and Proportion in Class 7 of NCERT.</p>
    <h4>Unitary Method</h4>
    <p>The method in which we first find the value of one unit and then the value
      of the
      <br>required number of units is known as the unitary method. Suppose the cost
      of 6
      <br>cans is &nbsp;₹ 210. To find the cost of 4 cans, using the unitary method,
      we first find the
      <br>cost of 1 can. It is &nbsp;₹&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(\frac{210}{6}\)</span>.
      or ₹ 35. From this, we find the price of 4 cans as ₹&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(35*4 =140\)</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Unitary Method Extended</h4>
    <p>Suppose a box of type A contains a bag of 5 Chocolates and another bag
      of 2 Biscuits.. Then if I have 5 boxes, then I have 5 bags each containing
      5 chocolates, and 5 bags each containing 2 Biscuits.</p>
    <p>Suppose some one tells me, I have 60 Chocolates and 24 Biscuits, and asks
      how many boxes of type A, do I have ?</p>
    <p>Unitary method tells us that &nbsp;there 12 boxes of type A.</p>
    <p>Let us take a different problem:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Each box of type B has two bags, first bag containing some number
      of chocolates and second bag containing some number of Biscuits. I have
      7 boxes of type B., making me own &nbsp;98 Chocolates and 84 Biscuits.
      My Friend has 56 Chocolates and 48 Biscuits. How many boxes of type B does
      he have ?</p>
    <p>By Unitary method, <strong>one</strong> box of type B will have a bag of&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(98+7 = 14\)</span>&nbsp;Chocolates in a bag, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(84+7 = 12\)</span>&nbsp;Biscuits
        in a bag. So, for 56 Chocolates and 48 Biscuits, the number of boxes should
        be&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(56+14=4\)</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(48+12=4\)</span>&nbsp;boxes.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
