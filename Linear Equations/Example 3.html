     <h1>Example 3: Solution to Pair of Equations by converting to Ratios - II</h1>


    <h2>Solve</h2>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(2x+3y+4z=18\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(3x+4y+5z=36\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(x+2y+3z=42\)</span>
    </p>
    <h2>Identify Proportions with x+y+z</h2>
    <p>Re-writing each equation as below</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(2(x+y+z) +(y+3z)=18\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(3(x+y+z) + (y+2z) = 36\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x+y+z) +(y+2z) = 42\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>Since second and third equation have same terms with different ratios,
      &nbsp;No solution exists.</p>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>Equations that are linear combinations do not have solutions. This is
      a concept described in Matrices in Class 11. This can be seen by expressing
      the equations in ratios.</p>
    <p><u>Insights into Design of Experiment</u> :</p>
    <p>This also tells us that while doing experiments, and collecting data,
      it is important to have variations in data, and not collect data that have
      proportional relationships in input. &nbsp;For example, to understand how
      many moles of a compound A is needed to react with two other compounds
      B and C. It is not a good idea to conduct the experiment where first case
      say takes 1 mole each of B and C, and second test takes 2 moles each of
      B and C. Rather the second experiment could contain 2 moles of B and 0.5
      mole of C.</p>
