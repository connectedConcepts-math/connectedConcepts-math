     <h1>Connected Concepts</h1>

    

    <h2><i>"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."</i></h2>
    <h3 style="margin-left:360px;">- Law of Geography</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;This law very succinctly brings out the importance of connectedness.
      &nbsp; “Spatial analysis” in geography would have been difficult without
      first law of geography. Though it was written in view of Geography, it
      captures the essence in Mathematics. While some things may appear far,
      their nearness is appreciated by knowing the underlying “relatedness”.</p>
    <h2>Why Connected Concepts?</h2>
    <p>The Problems in real-life do not present themselves with clear cut data
      to solve. Real life problems are typically solved by “connecting the dots”.
      &nbsp;If the students are aware that the “dot can be connected”, they will
      explore. This book will help teachers to bring out that awareness.</p>
    <h2>Need for a book on this topic&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>There are many books on school mathematics books including the school
      textbooks. that are oriented to the curriculum prescribed per Class by
      their board. Interestingly so, these books have different structure of
      the content, as the authors view on flow of content. That there are various
      flows amongst the concepts (but spread in different books) is in itself
      an existing indication that there are “connected concepts” in different
      order.</p>
    <p>There are many other books that are oriented to provide with lots of examples
      and exercises .They are organized with the view that students will figure
      out the relationship amongst the concepts by solving numerous examples..
      This approach works only with students who are aware about “connected concepts”
      and consciously exercise towards identifying them.</p>
    <p>The challenge with bringing out the view of “connected concepts” and the
      importance &nbsp;of it through these books is ln itself a daunting task
      for the teachers, despite teachers desire to bring about existence of “connected
      concepts”. &nbsp;Some of the reason for these are&nbsp;</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>Connected concepts (few of them), though directly referenced, are spread
        across the chapters in various classes. Teachers find it difficult to guide
        students through multiple textbooks/chapters , while their focus is on
        particular concept per lesson plan.</li>
      <li>Connected concepts are hidden within the examples and exercises. While
        solving these exercises, the usual tendency is to complete the exercise
        and not focus on the “interpretations” and “implication" so as to obtain
        a larger view. &nbsp;Many times the exercises are designed such that with
        &nbsp;extra thought, the concepts in the following chapters/classes can
        be built ( from the learnt concepts). However, again since these relations
        are spread across multiple chapters/classes and lack of awareness of existence
        of such links impends learning the “connections”</li>
      <li>Many connected concepts are difficult to be learnt and recognized, specially
        when mathematics is treated and taught as different branches - Arithmetic,,
        Algebra, Geometry &nbsp;and Calculus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What will this book cover ?</h2>
    <p>Will cover the interconnectedness across various topics,. This will teachers
      to help students</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To develop or build concepts from what they already know.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>To guide students to appreciate the concepts by letting them know how
        it will be used in future,</li>
      <li>To build a problem-solving mindset in students..&nbsp;</li>
      <h4> Currently the content has been created to connect the thread of <em> Linearity </em> across the classes. </h4>
      <p>This will later be expanded to other topics</p>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to use this book?</h2>
    <p>Currently, the idea is to use this as a refresher course after class X. However, as there are some critical concepts that child should learn by Class 8/9, some of these concepts can be interjected with existing curriculum - Seeking ideas from readers as to the approach of the same.</p>
