     <h1>Solving Linear Equations as Equivalent Fractions</h1>

    <p>Using Equivalent fractions : Linear equations that are formed as ratios
      will be converted to equivalent fractions and solved using ‚Äú Visual Fractions‚Äù
      ( Like the whole-part diagrams that are introduced in Class 4/5. &nbsp;The
      same problem is solved without the need for visuals.</p>
   
    <h4>Example 1</h4>
    <p>Ratio of John's age to his Father 10 years ago is 1:5. Six years later,
      the ratio of their ages becomes 3:7. &nbsp;Find their current ages.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Visual approach</h3>

    </figure>
    <p>The idea here is to make bars representing the two quantities, showing
      the ‚Äúparts‚Äù used in each ratio without knowing their actual size, and relate
      them to one another.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the particular problem, the ratios of the ages were such that the difference
      in ratio was 4 (constant) . Hence the bars representing the ratios could
      be aligned easily.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Next is an example, where the difference in ratios are not the same.</p>
    <h3>Algebraic formulation&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>Let J be John's age, and F be Father's age.</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((J-10):(F-10) = 1:5\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;[ 10
      years ago]</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((J+6):(F+6) = 3:7\)</span>&nbsp; [ 6 years later
      ]</p>
    
    <p>Using Proportions :</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((J+6):)J-10)::3:1\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(16:(J-10)::4:1\)</span>&nbsp;( Using Componendo)</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(15:(J-10)::16:4\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;or&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\((J-10)=4 &nbsp;\space J=14\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>Similarly,</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((F+6):(F-10) :: 7:5\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(16L(F-10) :: 2:5\)</span>
    </p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(16L(F-10) :: 15:30 or F=50\)</span>
    </p>
    <h4>Example 2</h4>
    <p style="margin-left:0cm;">Today, the ratio of John‚Äôs age to his father‚Äôs is <strong>1:6</strong>.
      In 6 years, it will be <strong>1:3</strong>. How old are they?</p>
    <p style="margin-left:0cm;">Notice that the difference in ratio of ages of Father and John, in first
      case (Current) is 6-1 = 5. The difference in ages of Father and Jon, 6
      years later, is 3-1 = 2. As a result of difference in these ages not being
      same, the bars representing them will not align, as seen in the below :</p>
    <figure
    class="image">
      <img src="Ratio%20and%20Proportions/Solution%20of%20Linear%20Equations/Solving%20Linear%20Equations%20as%20Equivalent%20Fractions/2_image.png">
      </figure>
      <p style="margin-left:0cm;">The bars don‚Äôt have the same scale in each ratio, as we see from the fact
        that the difference of ages is not the same; so we can‚Äôt just add years.
        We need to rescale the diagrams so that the difference is the same size
        in each.</p>
      <p style="margin-left:0cm;">To make them line up, we need to make&nbsp;<strong>equivalent ratios</strong> such
        that the&nbsp;<strong>differences</strong>, rather than being 5 and 2,&nbsp;<strong>will both be 10</strong> (the
        LCM). So I multiply by 2 and 5, respectively, rewriting&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1:6\)</span>&nbsp;as&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(2:12\)</span>, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(1:3\)</span>&nbsp;as&nbsp;
          <span
          class="math-tex">\(5:15\)</span>. The new bars do line up correctly</p>
      <figure class="image">
        <img src="Ratio%20and%20Proportions/Solution%20of%20Linear%20Equations/Solving%20Linear%20Equations%20as%20Equivalent%20Fractions/4_image.png">
      </figure>
      <p>Clearly 3 units makes 6 years, so each unit is 2 years. so&nbsp;John was
        4 and his father was 24. (In 6 years, they will be 10 and 30, with the
        required ratio.)</p>
      <h3>Algebraic formulation&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;Original Ratio</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\(ùêΩ:ùêπ=1:6\)</span>&nbsp;[ Now]</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((ùêΩ+6):(ùêπ+6)=1:3\)</span>&nbsp;[ 6 years from
        now]</p>
      <p>After transforming the Ratio into proportion &nbsp;such that the difference
        between numerator and denominator is same</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\(J:F :: 2:12\)</span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((ùêΩ+6):(ùêπ+6)=5:15\)</span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((J+6):J :: 5:2\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; or&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(6:J :: 3:2\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;gives&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(J=4\)</span>
      </p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((F+6):F :: 15:12\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;or&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(F=24\)</span>
      </p>
      <h4>Intuitive approach</h4>
      <p>Let us look at a general problem (without the numerals).</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;years ago , ratio of John's age
        to Father's age is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(a:b\)</span>. &nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp;years later the ratio becomes&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(c:d\)</span>.
          &nbsp;Find the present age of John and Father.</p>
      <p>Notation : Let&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(J\)</span>&nbsp;be John's
        current age,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(F\)</span>&nbsp;be Father's
        current age and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(D\)</span>&nbsp;be the actual
        difference between age of John and age of Father.</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;years ago,&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(D= \frac{(b-a)}{a} *J\)</span>, which implies&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(m\)</span>&nbsp;years
          ago &nbsp;John;s age was&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\(n\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;years later,&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(D = \frac{(d-c)}{c}*J\)</span>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;complete the approach &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h4>Observation from these examples</h4>
      <p>In both the examples, the algebraic formulation was of the type&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-a) : (y-a) :: m:n\)</span>&nbsp; [ a years
        before ]</p>
      <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-b):(y-b) :: p:q\)</span>&nbsp; [ b years before
        ]</p>
      <p>In both the equations, the number subtracted ( could be added, depending
        on context) in both numerator and denominator are the same.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Approach could be used when&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((m-n)=(p-q)\)</span>.
        When&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((m-n) \neq (p-q)\)</span>, then equivalent
        fractions have to be established on right hand side.</p>
      <p>The &nbsp;approach begets the question, Can this approach be used to solve
        pair of linear equations that are NOT expressed as ratios, that is the
        equations are expressed in the form of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(ax+by=r\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
        <span
        class="math-tex">\(cx+dy =s\)</span>&nbsp;? The next examples will cover conversion of
          equations of this form to ratio form and then solve them.</p>
