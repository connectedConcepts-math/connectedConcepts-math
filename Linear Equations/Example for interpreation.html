     <h1>Interpretation of Ratios - Example</h1>

    
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >A bolt manufacturer can produce 6 bolts per day. He equally distributes all the bolts manufactured for 30 days among his 3 customers. </span></p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >How much does each customer get?</span>
    </p>
    <p>An assumption is this problem is that all bolts manufactured are equally
      distributed amongst the three customers. The equal distribution can happen
      in at least 3 different ways</p>
    <p>a) Manufacture all the bolts, and then distribute equally.</p>
    <p>b) On a daily basis distribute amongst the three customers the produce
      for the day</p>
    <p>c) Compute the total to be produced, and find the number to be distributed
      for each customer. Use this number to distribute to first customer, then
      to second and to third. Ship to one customer at a time.</p>
    <h4>Solution Method a) : Manufacture all the bolts, and then distribute equally</h4>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts manufactured per day = 6 bolts/ day</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of days = 30 days</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Total number of bolts manufactured = 6 (bolts per day) *30 (days) = 180 bolts</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number&nbsp; of customers =3 customers</span>
    </p>
    <p><span >Number of bolts each customer receives = 180 (bolts)/3 (customers)&nbsp; = 60 bolts per customer (Answer)</span>
    </p>
    <h4><span >Solution Method b) On a daily basis distribute amongst the three customers the produce </span><span >for the day&nbsp;</span></h4>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts manufactured in a day = 6 bolts /day</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of Customers = 3 customers</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts each customer receives every day = 6/3 = 2 (bolts per day per customer)</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of days = 30.days</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts each customer receives in 30 days = 2 (bolts per day/customer) * 30 days = 60 bolts per customer</span>
    </p>
    <h4 style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Solution Method c) Ship to one customer at a time</span></h4>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of days = 30 days</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of customers = 3 customer</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of day’s worth each customer receives = 30 (days) / 3 (customers) = 10 days worth&nbsp; / customer.</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts manufactured per day = 6 bolts day worth</span>
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left:0in;"><span >Number of bolts each customer gets = 6(bolts per day) * 10 (days worth /customer) = 60 bolts per customer.</span>
    </p>
