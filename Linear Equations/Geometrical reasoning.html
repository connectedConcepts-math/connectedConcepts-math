     <h1>Geometrical Reasoning = Solution to Pair of Equations by converting to Ratios - I</h1>


    <p>In this note, we will see with an example</p>
    <ul>
      <li>why the difference in numerator and denominator if the equations on the
        right side have to be same</li>
      <li>why the factors in x in both the equations are proportional. Similarly,
        why the variables in y, in both equations are proportional.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preliminaries</h2>
    <p>In both the examples, the algebraic formulation was of the type&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-a) : (y-a) :: m:n\)</span>&nbsp; [ a years
      before ]</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-b):(y-b) :: p:q\)</span>&nbsp; [ b years before
      ]</p>
    <p>The approach &nbsp;used needed &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((m-n)=(p-q)\)</span>.
      When&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((m-n) \neq (p-q)\)</span>, then equivalent
      fractions have to be established on right hand side.</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-a) : (y-a) :: m:n\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp;- (I)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;is of the form</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(nx+my=d\)</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -
      (2) &nbsp; &nbsp; when expanded.</p>
    <p>When &nbsp;every point on the line in equation (2) is subtracted by ‘a’
      , then equation of form (1) is formed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Both Equation (1) and Eq (2) are lines that are parallel to each other.
      The line in Eq(1) passes through origin, where as line through Eq (2) passes
      through&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((0,\frac{d}{m})\)</span>. Point&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\((a,a)\)</span>&nbsp;lies on Eq (1)</p>
    <p>Similarly,&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-b):(y-b) :: p:q\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -(3)
      &nbsp; is of the form</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(qx+py=f\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- (4)</p>
    <p>Eq (3). &nbsp;passes through Origin, and Point&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((b,b)\)</span>&nbsp;lies
      on Eq3. &nbsp;Eq 3, is line parallel to Eq 4.</p>
    <p>If we can consider&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x,y)\)</span>&nbsp;is
      the point of intersection of Eq2, Eq4, then&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x-a,y-a)\)</span>&nbsp;will
      lie on Eq1, and&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x-b,y-b)\)</span>&nbsp;will
      lie on Eq3. Since we are moving, equal units by a (or by b) to left and
      down, &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x,y) \space, (x-a,y-a) \space, (x-b,y-b)\)</span>&nbsp;will
      lie on a line that has an inclination of 45 degree ( slope 1).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Using these preliminaries, we will see through an example how &nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\((m-n) = (p-q)\)</span>. And through it, find value of&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x,y)\)</span>&nbsp;using
        an example.</p>
    <p>In the picture below&nbsp;</p>
    <p>L1' and L2 ' are two equations, of the ratio form [ Eq1, Eq3]/.</p>
    <p>In Triangle, HDB,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(GD=m \space DB = n\)</span>.
      Point B is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x-a,y-a)\)</span>.</p>
    <p>IN triangle HFC,&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(HF=p \space FC=q\)</span>.
      Point C is&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x-c,y-c)\)</span>&nbsp;.</p>
    <p>Since points B and C line on a line with slope 1, EB = EC, showing that
      &nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\(p-m=q-n\)</span>. This is same as&nbsp;
      <span
      class="math-tex">\(m-n=p-q\)</span>.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <figure class="image">
      <img src="Ratio%20and%20Proportions/Solution%20of%20Linear%20Equations/Geometrical_reasonong_equivalent_fractions.png">
    </figure>

    <p>Also, same picture tells us</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((x-a):(x-b) ::m:p\)</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      &nbsp; and&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\((y-a):(y-b) :: n:q\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>This gives us the proportional relationship.</p>
    <h2>This approach shifts origin to point of intersection</h2>
    <p>Another way to look at this approach, is to think about it as if the coordinate
      system axis are transferred to the lines under consideration, and the origin
      in original coordinate system is shifted to the point of intersection of
      the lines.</p>
    <p>Akgebraically , if the equations of lines in orthogonal coordinate axis
      as</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(y=m_{1}x+b_{1} &nbsp; \space and \space y = m_{2}x+b_{2}\)</span>&nbsp;
      &nbsp;with usual notation.</p>
    <p>At the point of intersection&nbsp;<span class="math-tex">\((x_{p},y_{p})\)</span>,
      the x and y coordinates on both lines are same.</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(y_{p}=m_{1}x_{p}+b_{1} &nbsp; \space and \space y_{p} = m_{2}x_{p}+b_{2}\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>Subtracting we get,</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(x_{p} = \frac{b_{2}-b_{1}}{m_{2}-m_{1}}\)</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span class="math-tex">\(y_{p} = \frac{m_{1}b_{2}-m_{2}b_{1}}{m_{1}-m_{2}}\)</span>
    </p>
    <p>which is the same scaling that can be observed from the similar triangles
      [ Left as an exercise]</p>
